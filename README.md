Abstract

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a major threat to the security of internet infrastructure. These attacks can disrupt or disable critical services, causing significant financial and reputational damage. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising technique for detecting DDoS attacks. ML algorithms can learn from historical network traffic data to identify patterns that are indicative of DDoS attacks. However, traditional ML algorithms may not be well-suited for detecting DDoS attacks due to the dynamic nature of these attacks and the increasing complexity of network traffic.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced DDoS detection system that utilizes a combination of ML algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of DDoS detection. Our system first extracts relevant features from network traffic data, such as packet size, packet count, and flow duration. Then, it applies a hybrid ML model that combines the strengths of multiple ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms traditional ML algorithms in terms of detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and computational efficiency.
